# Movie-Review-Classification
Simple example for implementation of binary classification in keras using the IMDB Dataset
This model uses the reviews and constricts the length to 10,000 words, thereby saving on compuation time and uses a pre indexing of words to integers. The architecture is pretty simple aqnd consists of 2 densely connected layers in a sequential model.
